# Donation App

## Inspiration  
Our idea was to make donation easier by providing people with a user-friendly platform for the same purpose.  
This app makes it easy for people to find local charities, food banks, and other organizations to support.  
It helps us figure out the requirements of these local charities at all times.  

This is where our idea for the **Donation App** was born. Its aim is to connect donors with local charities, food banks, and non-profit organizations in their community.

## Features  
- **Centralized Database**:  
  A centralized database eases the search for organizations needing support. It provides up-to-date information on the specific items and resources these organizations currently require.

- **AI-Powered Image Recognition**:  
  The app features an AI tool that recognizes images of objects donors wish to donate.  
  It generates a comprehensive donation list within seconds by automatically identifying and categorizing each item.
